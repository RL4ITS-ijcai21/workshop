            Intelligent transportation systems (ITS) are integrated systems that use advanced computer and
            communication technologies in road transportation, including vehicles, users, and
            infrastructure, and in traffic and mobility management, as well as for interfaces with other
            modes of transportation. There are challenging dynamic decision problems and critical questions
            that readily stand to benefit tremendously from artificial intelligence (AI), for example:
          <ul>
            <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i> How should vehicles and passengers be matched in an
              optimal way to maximize the efficiency of a mobility-on-demand system?
            </li>
            <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i> How do we rebalance/reposition a fleet of vehicles to
              maximize overall system utilization?
            </li>
            <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i> How can traffic signals adapt intelligently to the
              dynamic traffic patterns?
            </li>
            <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i> How does an autonomous vehicle respond to human driver
              behavior in a mixed autonomy traffic?
            </li>
            <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i> What can be done in particular to generate safe control
              policies in an ITS?
            </li>
          </ul>
          A lot of these problems have a common characteristic that a sequence of decisions are to be made
          while we care about some cumulative objectives over a length of horizon.
          Reinforcement learning (RL) is a machine learning paradigm that trains an agent to learn to take
          optimal actions (as measured by the total cumulative reward achieved) in an environment through
          interactions with it and getting feedback signals. It is thus a class of optimization methods for
          solving sequential decision-making problems. Thanks to the rapid advancement in deep learning
          research and computing capabilities, the integration of deep neural networks and RL has generated
          explosive progress in the latter for solving complex large-scale learning problems, attracting huge
          amount of renewed interests in the recent years. The combination of deep learning and RL has even
          been considered as a path to general AI. It presents a tremendous potential to solve some hard
          problems in transportation in an unprecedented way and to have profound positive impact on the daily
          lives of our community.
          RL for ITS is an emerging interdisciplinary area that is undergoing rapid development and still
          require further understanding on a number of issues, e.g., dynamic environments, run-time
          performance, and safe deployment.
          The main goal of this workshop is to bring together researchers and practitioners from both the RL
          and transportation communities to answer the following questions:
          <br>
          <ul>
            <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i> What are the recent advances in the state-of-the-art of
              RL for ITS?
            </li>
            <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i> What are the new application areas in transportation
              that can be benefited by RL?
            </li>
            <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i> What are the successful stories in real-world
              applications of RL to ITS?
            </li>
            <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i> What are the challenges and critical issues that may
              have significant impact on a successful application?
            </li>
          </ul>
          Answering these questions is critical to unleash the potential of the core intelligence in ITS
          beyond classical machine learning. We hope the participants will leave the workshop with a better
          idea about the current status of RL for ITS, about what is working well and what is not, thus
          providing guidance on directions of future research in this exciting area.

            The workshop is non-archival, and there will not be formal proceedings, although papers will be
            available on the workshop website. Papers that are under review at another conference or journal are
            acceptable for submission at this workshop, but we will not accept papers that have already been
            accepted or published at a venue with formal proceedings (including IJCAI 2021). The submitted
            papers will be peer-reviewed by at least two PC members. A Best Paper Award will be presented to the
            best submitted paper as voted by the reviewers. All papers are to be presented at the poster
            sessions. A select group of papers will be given the opportunity to present at the spotlight
            sessions during the workshop. We also plan to invite the spotlight papers to expand and submit to a
            reputable journal in computer science or transportation.
          </p>

                  Title:
                  Social motion planning for autonomous vehicles
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Abstract:
                  We move towards an era of smart cities, where autonomous vehicles will provide on-demand transportation and make our streets safer - while coexisting with humans and other road users. The motion plan of the autonomous vehicle must therefore account for the interaction with other traffic participants and consider that they are, as well, decision-making agents. For example, when humans drive a car, they are fully aware of their environment and how other drivers and pedestrians may react to their future actions. In this talk I will give an overview of our work in motion planning among other decision-making vehicles, which combines reinforcement learning and trajectory optimization to be able to provide a certain level of guarantees while leveraging learning to achieve social behaviors. After a brief introduction to receding-horizon trajectory optimization framework, I will discuss three methods to enhance the motion planner with learning. Namely: using inverse reinforcement learning and social value estimation to achieve social behaviors; employing a learned policy to guide the motion planner in dense traffic scenarios; and achieving social trajectories by learning from a dataset of human-driven vehicles.

                  <b> Title: Lagrangian control at large and local scales in mixed autonomy traffic
                    flow</b>
                  <br>
                  Abstract:
                  <br>
                  This talk investigates Lagrangian (mobile) control of traffic flow at local scale
                  (vehicular level). The question of how self-driving vehicles will change traffic
                  flow patterns is investigated. We describe approaches based on deep reinforcement
                  learning presented in the context of enabling mixed-autonomy mobility. The talk
                  explores the gradual and complex integration of automated vehicles into the existing
                  traffic system. We present the potential impact of a small fraction of automated
                  vehicles on low-level traffic flow dynamics, using novel techniques in model-free
                  deep reinforcement learning, in which the automated vehicles act as mobile
                  (Lagrangian) controllers to traffic flow.
                  <br>
                  Illustrative examples will be presented in the context of a new open-source
                  computational platform called FLOW, which integrates state of the art
                  microsimulation tools with deep-RL libraries on AWS EC2. Interesting behavior of
                  mixed autonomy traffic will be revealed in the context of emergent behavior of
                  traffic: <a

                  <br>
                  Abstract:
                  <br>
                  Motivated to address the real-world traffic problem, our research group has produced
                  a series of
                  studies on reinforcement learning for traffic signal control. However, our research
                  results face
                  difficulties to be implemented in the real world because of the reality gap between
                  the simulation
                  environment and the real environment. In this talk, I would like to share what I
                  learnt in attempt
                  to bridge the reality gap.

                    Abstract:
                    <br>
                    Simulations are essential for the development of autonomous driving solutions.
                    In addition to simulation of physical dynamics and static environment
                    structures, simulation of the interactive behaviors of social agents sharing the
                    same traffic environment as the autonomous driving AI is also a huge challenge
                    needing an adequate solution. Without adequate simulation of interactive
                    behaviors of social agents, autonomous driving simulators will never be adequate
                    for testing or training the autonomous driving AI. In this talk, we look at how
                    to bootstrap the simulation of interactive behaviors for autonomous driving
                    research without having to have already solved the challenge of building fully
                    competent autonomous driving, or for that matter autonomous walking and biking,
                    AI.

                    Title: Online Sequential Matching for Improving Efficiency in Urban Environments
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Abstract:
                    <br>
                    Rapid “urbanization” (more than 50% of worlds’ population now resides in cities)
                    coupled with the natural lack of coordination in usage of common resources (ex:
                    bikes, ambulances, taxis, traffic personnel, attractions) has a detrimental
                    effect on a wide variety of response (ex: waiting times, response time for
                    emergency needs) and coverage metrics (ex: predictability of traffic/security
                    patrols) in cities of today. Motivated by the need to improve response and
                    coverage metrics in urban environments, I will talk about our research on
                    building intelligent agent systems that make sequential decisions to
                    continuously match available supply of resources to an uncertain demand for
                    resources. Our broad approach to generating these sequential decision strategies
                    is through a combination of machine learning and sequential optimization
                    methods, while exploiting structure (anonymity, limited influence, abstraction
                    etc.) in problems. I will specifically delve into our recent research on
                    developing online optimization methods (including Deep RL) that can handle
                    operational constraints and show some of our recent results on real world
                    datasets.

                    Title: Learning to delay for ride-sourcing services
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Abstract:
                    <br>
                    Ride-sourcing services are now reshaping the way people travel by effectively
                    connecting drivers and passengers through mobile internets. The matching time
                    interval (the time interval over which waiting passengers and idle drivers are
                    accumulated and then subjected to peer-to-peer matching) and matching radius (or
                    maximum allowable pick-up distance, within which waiting passengers and idle
                    drivers can be matched or paired) are two key control variables that a platform
                    can employ to optimize system performance in an online matching system. In this
                    study, we propose an optimization model to dynamically adjust the matching time
                    interval and matching radius in response to real-time supply and demand
                    conditions. We show that the flexible matching time interval and matching radius
                    in the system level have potentials to improve overall system performance. In
                    the individual level, a specific passenger request can benefit from a delayed
                    matching since he/she may be matched with closer idle drivers after waiting for
                    a few seconds. Motivated by the potential benefits of delayed matching, we
                    further establish a two-stage framework which incorporates a combinatorial
                    optimization and multi-agent deep reinforcement learning methods. The
                    multi-agent reinforcement learning methods are used to dynamically determine the
                    delayed time for each passenger request (or the time at which each request
                    enters the matching pool), while the combinatorial optimization conducts an
                    optimal bipartite matching between idle drivers and waiting passengers in the
                    matching pool. The proposed framework is shown to substantially improve system
                    performances, by well balancing the trade-off among pick-up time, matching time
                    and successful matching rate.
